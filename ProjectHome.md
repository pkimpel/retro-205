The ElectroData Datatron 205 was a mid-1950s, vacuum-tube, drum-memory computer system. ElectroData was a spin-off from Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation of Pasadena, California, a company that made mass spectrometers.

ElectroData was acquired from CEC by the Burroughs Corporation in 1957 and became the foundation of the Burroughs commercial computer business. The ElectroData division of Burroughs went on to create a number of successful systems, including the B100/200/300 series, the B2000/3000/4000/V Series, the B5000/5500, and finally the B6000/7000/A Series, which are still produced and sold today as !Unisys ClearPath MCP systems.
