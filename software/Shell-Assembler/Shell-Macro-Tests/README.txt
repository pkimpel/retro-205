Source and assembly listings illustrating the use of macros and
subroutines for the Shell Research assembler for the Burroughs 205.

Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard Windows text
format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.


Sample-Macros.card
    Shell Assembler source card deck containing two sample macro
    definitions (from Section VII of Part I of the Shell Assembler
    Manual). Assembling these with the Shell-Assembler-Load.tape image
    above will generate an updated tape image with these macros inserted
    into the library.

Sample-Macros.lst
    Assembly listing of Sample-Macros.card above.

Sample-Macros.tape
    Updated assembler load tape image generated by assembling Sample-
    Macros.card using Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Sample-Macros-2.card
    Shell Assembler source card deck derived by removing the macro
    definitions from Sample-Macros.card above. This leaves the
    invocations of the two macros, but not their definitions. When
    assembled using Sample-Macros.tape above, this shows how predefined
    macros on the assembler load tape may be called out by subsequent
    assembly runs.

Sample-Macros-2.lst
    Assembly listing of Sample-Macros-2.card above showing the effect of
    macros called out from the Sample-Macros.tape assembler load tape.

Sample-Macros-3.card
    Similar to Sample-Macros.card, but using the MACRO pseudo-
    instruction instead of NEW and showing an example of a macro being
    invoked from within the body of another macro.

Sample-Macros-3.lst
    Assembly listing of Sample-Macros-3.card above.

Sample-SUBR.card
    Similar to Sample-Macros-2.card, but showing how the SUBR pseudo-
    instruction can be used to call out the body of a macro as a closed
    subroutine.
