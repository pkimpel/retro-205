Index of folder retro-205/software/Shell-Assembler/Shell-Utilities:
Source, object, and assembly listings for miscellaneous demos and
utilities the Shell Research assembler for the Burroughs 205, as
prepared for the retro-205 emulator.

Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard Windows text
format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.


Shell-Load-DataFile.card
    Card program to load Shell-Assembler-Load.tape from DataReader
    unit 1 to DataFile unit 0. 230 blocks starting at block 0120, lane
    1 of the DataReader are copied to block 0120, lane 89 of the
    DataFile.

Shell-Dump-DataFile.card
    Card program to dump the Shell Assembler load image from DataFile
    unit 0 to DataReader unit 1, blocks 0-500.

Shell-List-Character-Codes.card
    Shell Assembler source card deck for a program to list all 100
    Datatron 205 character codes to both the Flexowriter and Cardatron
    output unit #3 (assumed to be driving an IBM 407).

Shell-List-Character-Codes.lst
    Assembly listing for Shell-List-Character-Codes.card above. Includes
    output from the Cardatron and Flexowriter.

Shell-List-Character-Object.card
    Card deck containing the 5-per-card object deck generated by Shell
    Assembler from Shell-List-Character-Codes.card above, wrapped by the
    Shell-Object-Deck-Load program.

Winter-PI-Shell.card
    A program written in Shell Assembler to compute the first 800 digits
    of Pi. This has been converted from a one-line C program by Dik T.
    Winter of CWI in Amsterdam, as reported in:
    https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~alopez-o/math-faq/mathtext/node12.html.
    See also https://crypto.stanford.edu/pbc/notes/pi/code.html.
    The program outputs four digits at a time to the Flexowriter. Each
    four-digit group takes almost six minutes to generate, so a full run
    should take almost 20 hours.

Winter-PI-Object-Deck.card
    Loadable object card deck for the Winter-PI program.

Winter-PI-Shell.lst
    Assembler listing of the Winter-PI-Shell.card program, followed by
    the output of the program to the Flexowriter.
