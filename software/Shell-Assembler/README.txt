Index of folder retro-205/software/Shell-Assembler:
Source, object, and compile listings for the Shell Research assembler
for the Burroughs 205, as prepared for the retro-205 emulator.

Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard Windows text
format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.


Shell-Assembler-M1.shell
    Assembly listing of the "first movement" (first pass) of the Shell
    Assembler, transcribed by Paul Kimpel from Tom Sawyer's copy of the
    "Shell Symbolic Assembly Program for the Burroughs 205", Part II,
    Bulletin 3038, Burroughs Corporation, March 1960 (originally EPR
    Memorandum Report 37, Shell Development Company, Houston, Texas,
    September 1958).

Shell-Assembler-M1.card
    Source card deck for the Shell Assembler first movement extracted
    from the transcribed listing file.

Shell-Assembler-M1.lst
    Assembly listing of the first movement produced by assembling
    -M1.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M1-Output.card
    Punched card load deck of the first movement produced by assembling
    -M1.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M1-Output.tape
    Object code load tape of the first movement produced by assembling
    -M1.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M2.shell
    Assembly listing of the "second movement" (second pass) of the Shell
    Assembler, transcribed by Paul Kimpel from Tom Sawyer's copy of the
    "Shell Symbolic Assembly Program for the Burroughs 205", Part II,
    ibid.

Shell-Assembler-M2.card
    Source card deck for the Shell Assembler second movement extracted
    from the transcribed listing file.

Shell-Assembler-M2.lst
    Assembly listing of the second movement produced by assembling
    -M2.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M2-Output.card
    Punched card load deck of the second movement produced by assembling
    -M2.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M2-Output.tape
    Object code load tape of the second movement produced by assembling
    -M2.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-Bootstrap.card
    One-card program to load Shell-Assembler-Load.tape from unit 0, lane
    89 (DataFile) or lane 1 (tape drive). Format-6 band selection digit
    in columns 1-3. Use with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-Load.tape
    Loadable tape image of the Shell Assembler extracted from the
    transcribed listing files for the first and second movements.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.card
    Shell Assembler source card deck containing two sample macro definitions (from Section VII of Part I of the Shell Assembler Manual). Assembling these with the Shell-Assembler-Load.tape image above will generate an updated tape image with these macros inserted into the library.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.lst
    Assembly listing of Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.card above.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.tape
    Updated assembler load tape image generated by assembling Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.card using Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros-2.card
    Shell Assembler source card deck derived by removing the macro definitions from Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.card above. This leaves the invocations of the two macros, but not their definitions. When assembled using Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.tape above, this shows how predefined macros on the assembler load tape may be called out by subsequent assembly runs.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros-2.lst
    Assembly listing of Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros-2.card above showing the effect of macros called out from the Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros.tape assembler load tape.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros-3.card
    Similar to Sample-Macros.card, but using the MACRO pseudo-instruction instead of NEW and showing an example of a macro being invoked from within the body of another macro.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros-3.lst
    Assembly listing of Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-Macros-3.card above.

Shell-Macro-Tests/Sample-SUBR.card
    Similar to Sample-Macros-2.card, but showing how the SUBR pseudo-instruction can be used to call out the body of a macro as a closed subroutine.
