Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard Windows text
format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.


Shell-Assembler-M1.shell
    Assembly listing of the "first movement" (first pass) of the Shell
    Assembler, transcribed by Paul Kimpel from Tom Sawyer's copy of the
    "Shell Symbolic Assembly Program for the Burroughs 205", Part II,
    Bulletin 3038, Burroughs Corporation, March 1960 (originally EPR
    Memorandum Report 37, Shell Development Company, Houston, Texas,
    September 1958).

Shell-Assembler-M1.card
    Source card deck for the Shell Assembler first movement extracted
    from the transcribed listing file.

Shell-Assembler-M1.lst
    Assembly listing of the first movement produced by assembling
    -M1.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M1-Output.card
    Punched card load deck of the first movement produced by assembling
    -M1.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M1-Output.tape
    Object code load tape of the first movement produced by assembling
    -M1.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M2.shell
    Assembly listing of the "second movement" (second pass) of the Shell
    Assembler, transcribed by Paul Kimpel from Tom Sawyer's copy of the
    "Shell Symbolic Assembly Program for the Burroughs 205", Part II,
    ibid.

Shell-Assembler-M2.card
    Source card deck for the Shell Assembler second movement extracted
    from the transcribed listing file.

Shell-Assembler-M2.lst
    Assembly listing of the second movement produced by assembling
    -M2.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M2-Output.card
    Punched card load deck of the second movement produced by assembling
    -M2.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-M2-Output.tape
    Object code load tape of the second movement produced by assembling
    -M2.card with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape.

Shell-Assembler-Bootstrap.card
    One-card program to load Shell-Assembler-Load.tape from unit 0, lane
    89 (DataFile) or lane 1 (tape drive). Format-6 band selection digit
    in columns 1-3. Use with Shell-Assembler-Load.tape. Leaves the card
    reader with Reload Lockout set, so the source deck can immediately
    follow this one with no blank cards for padding.

Shell-Assembler-Load.tape
    Loadable tape image of the Shell Assembler extracted from the
    transcribed listing files for the first and second movements. This
    tape image has been manually modified to print the assembly listing
    single-spaced.

Shell-Object-Deck-Loader.card
    Skeleton card deck to load 5-per-card object decks generated by the
    Shell Assembler, transcribed from the Shell Assembler manual, part
    1, page 55. To use, copy this deck as a different name and insert
    the punched object deck as indicated in the deck.

Shell-Macro-Tests/
    Card decks and listings illustrating a simple program using
    assembler macros and subroutines.

Shell-Utilities/
    Card decks and listings for miscellaneous written in or for use with
    the Shell Assembler.
