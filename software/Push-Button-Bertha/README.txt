Source and object code for the music generation program for the
Burroughs 205 computer.

The program was originally written by Douglas Bolitho of Burroughs and
Dr. Martin Klein of North America Aviation. The only notable song it
produced was "Push Button Bertha" with lyrics supplied by Jack Owens.

The machine language program was transcribed and made to run by Tom
Sawyer. Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard Windows
text format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.

Note that this program requires a Datatron system with the option to
print 203/204 Flexowriter codes instead of the more common Cardatron
codes.
