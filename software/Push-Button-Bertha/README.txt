Index of folder retro-205/software/Push-Button-Bertha:
Source and object code for the music generation program for the
Burroughs 205 computer.

The program was originally written by Dr. Martin Klein of North American
Aviation and Douglas Bolitho of Burroughs. The only notable song it
produced was "Push Button Bertha" with lyrics supplied by Jack Owens.

The machine language program was originally transcribed and made to run
by Tom Sawyer. Unless otherwise specified, all files are in standard
Windows text format, with carriage-return/line-feed delimiters.

Note that this program requires a Datatron system with the option to
print 203/204 Flexowriter codes instead of the more common Cardatron
codes. That option was released in retro-205 emulator version 1.03.
