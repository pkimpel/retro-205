# retro-205

The ElectroData Datatron 205 was a mid-1950s, decimal, vacuum-tube, drum-memory computer system. The system was originally developed by Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation (CEC) of Pasadena, California, a company that made mass spectrometers.

Analysis of mass spectrometer output required solving sets of simultaneous linear equations. CEC initially set out to build a digital electronic calculator for this purpose, but soon switched to designing a full computer. The initial product was the 201, on which Ernst Selmer and Harry Husky consulted during the design phase. As the system became successful, CEC spun off the computer business as a partly-owned subsidiary, ElectroData. Over the next few years, the 201 evolved through a series of models into the 205.

ElectroData was acquired by the Burroughs Corporation in 1956 and became the foundation of the Burroughs commercial computer business. The ElectroData Division of Burroughs went on to create a number of successful systems, including the B100/200/300 series, the B2000/3000/4000/V Series, the B5000/5500, and finally the B6000/7000/A Series, which are still produced and sold today as Unisys ClearPath MCP systems.

The main goal of this project is creation of a web browser-based emulator for the 205. A second goal is reconstruction of the Algol-58 compiler written for the 205 by Donald Knuth in 1960.
