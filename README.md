# retro-205

The ElectroData Datatron 205 was a mid-1950s, decimal, vacuum-tube, drum-memory computer system. ElectroData was a spin-off from Consolidated Electrodynamics Corporation of Pasadena, California, who made mass spectrometers.

Analysis of mass spectrometer output required solving simultaneous linear equations. CEC initially set out to build a calculator for this purpose, but soon switched to designing a full digital computer. The initial product was the 201, which through a series of enhancements evolved into the 205. Ernst Selmer and Harry Husky consulted with CEC during the design phase.

ElectroData was acquired by the Burroughs Corporation in 1957 and became the foundation of the Burroughs commercial computer business. The ElectroData Division of Burroughs went on to create a number of successful systems, including the B100/200/300 series, the B2000/3000/4000/V Series, the B5000/5500, and finally the B6000/7000/A Series, which are still produced and sold today as !Unisys ClearPath MCP systems.

The main goal of this project is creation of a web browser-based implementation of the 205. A second goal is reconstruction of the Algol-58 compiler written for the 205 by Donald Knuth in 1960.
